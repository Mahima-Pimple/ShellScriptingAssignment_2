Develop a simple three item menu to display on the terminal. Your script, upon display of the menu, should prompt the user to choose one of the three available options. Using the 'case' statement from the course, display three unique messages depending on which number they chose, with a catch all message letting them know if they
went outside the bounds of instructions.

echo Enter Any Food You Want
read Food

case $Food in
    "Apple")
	echo "Price of $Food is 100 dollar" ;;
    "Mango")
	echo "Price of $Food is 50 dollar" ;;
    "Pineapple")
	echo "Price of $Food is 120 dollar" ;;
    * )
	echo "Unknown Food" ;;
