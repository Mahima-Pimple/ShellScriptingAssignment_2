Assignment02 

Write a script that sets FOUR variables:

MYUSERNAME
MYPASSWORD
STARTOFSCRIPT
ENDOFSCRIPT


Populate the first two with some default value and use 
command redirection to set the third and fourth value to the 
date/time of when the script was started and completed. 
Within the script, be sure to display the values to the terminal when run.

Solution :
MYUSERNAME=$USER
MYPASSWORD='password'
STARTOFSCRIPT='date'
ENDOFSCRIPT='date'
echo "My Username is $MYUSERNAME"
echo "My Password is $MYPASSWORD"
echo "started this Script at $STRATOFSCRIPT"
echo "Ended this Script at $ENDOFSCRIPT"
