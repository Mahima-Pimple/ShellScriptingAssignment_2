Assignment12

Write a script that will prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 3. Capture that number in a variable and then test that variable. Be sure to display the variable and it's value as appropriate within an if/then/else statement where the final statement will display if they did not enter a number between 1 and 3 telling them they failed to follow instructions. Redirect errors from each of the tests to /dev/null (to prevent script errors from showing if text is entered for example).

Solution :
echo "Enter the number between 1-3"
read number
if [ "$number" -ge 1 ] && [ "$number" -le 3 ]
then
  echo "$number is present in the range"
else
  echo "Failed to follow instructions"
fi

Output :

$ sh Assignment12.sh
Enter the number between 1-3

3 is present in the range

$ sh Assignment12.sh
Enter the number between 1-3
