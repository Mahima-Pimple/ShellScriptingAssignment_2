Assignment15
Create a script that prompts the user for a number. That number is to be used to display a simple message to the terminal X number of times (where X is the number captured from the user input). The message should include an indication of the number for each count the message is displayed.

Solution : 
echo "Enter any number"
read number
echo "$number number of times the number appears"
for (( i=1; i<=$number; i++ ))
do
  echo "The count is $i"
done
